Dragon growth

Some system of giving resources to dragon

I want to express emotions as well

Town where I can trade resources (get 80 apples for 100 wood or 80 wood for 100 apples or something)
    Later on you can build the store yourself
    
Inventory UI where you can click on stuff - maybe integrate with crafting system
    Okay, let's focus on what the game should have, not what's easiest to script
        Only really simple stuff should be in the mobile crafting panel, like tools; but isn't even that too much?

Dragon growth:
    Stage 0:
        Egg
        Can't do SHIT
        Needs food preparation and fire to grow
            Maybe if you hatch it with fire but don't have food it DIES
    Stage 1:
        Newborn
        At this point, it should be STRESSFUL keeping it alive; you shouldn't have enough resources to do other stuff like build
    Stage 2:
        Hatchling
        Don't be afraid to stay on this step for a much longer time than the others
    Stage 3:
        Toddler
        Needs fewer resources than before
        VERY cute
    Stage 4:
        Adolescent
        Should do something to help at this point; maybe keeps the fire lit or something
        During this step, have it disappear
            Have a trail into the woods or something to let the player know it's not a bug
            Goal of this is to make the user miss the hatchling
    Stage 5:
        Adolescent
        Returns larger than before
            Maybe have it look very skinny but muscular where there is muscle
        Maybe if you leave food in your "food bin" for too long, the hatchling eats it
            HOWEVER, the more food it eats from the food bin, it gets more muscle and less skinny
            This could also be the key to getting to the next stage
    Stage 6: Young Adult
        Muscular (not buff)
        Some drama should happen at this stage; dunno what yet
        Maybe leaves every other day to go hunting, then comes back and spends the other day eating what it got at home?
            Or it's every third day, and on the third day it accompanies you on your travels
                Maybe in the future make it so that you decide whether it follows you
        Abilities:
            Keeps the fire lit
            Accompanies you
    Stage 7: Adult
        A lot like young adult
        Very long stage
        This stage should have it helping you out a lot, allowing you to build a lot, including a little village around your home
    Stage 8: ??? Elder adult?
        A lot like adult
        Something should be different tho
    Stage 9: Middle aged
        Short stage; should let you know that something is changing
    Stage 10: Getting Old (change name)
        Defense should go down quite a bit; therefore, when you're out exploring with the hatchling, it'll get hurt easily
    Stage 11: Elder
        Stays at home
        The children of the village should play with them
        Another long stage
    Stage 12: Dying
        Heavy breathing
        Clearly struggling
