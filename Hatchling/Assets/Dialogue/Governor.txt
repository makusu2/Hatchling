Governor Well hello there! And welcome to my town!
Player Your town?
Governor That's right! It may not look like much right now, but eventually this land will be full of people!
Player Well, good luck with that!
Governor Actually, seeing as you're here, I've got a little request; I don't have enough supplies to build homes. Have you got any on you?
Player I might...
Governor Well, if you have a surplus, come back here and talk to me. I can't offer you any goods in return, but I can assure you that it'll be worth it once you see the town.
